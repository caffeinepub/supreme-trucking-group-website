# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the broken "Careers" navigation link in the Header component so it correctly navigates to the /careers route.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Careers nav item in the desktop navigation bar of `Header.tsx` to navigate to `/careers`, consistent with how the Resources link is implemented.
- Apply the same fix to the Careers entry in the mobile hamburger menu.

**User-visible outcome:** Clicking "Careers" in both the desktop and mobile navigation menus now navigates the user to the Careers page.
