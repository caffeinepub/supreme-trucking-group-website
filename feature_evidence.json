Inspect the current click handler or href for the Careers nav item and ensure it uses the router's navigation (e.g., router.navigate or an <a href='/careers'> / Link to='/careers') consistently with how the Resources page link is implemented. Apply the fix to both the desktop nav and the mobile hamburger menu.",
