  "summary": "The diff indicates that CareersPage.tsx has been modified to include JSON-LD structured data, but the implementation uses a useEffect hook to inject the script tag into the document head rather than placing it directly in the component's JSX return using dangerouslySetInnerHTML as required by REQ-9. The file summary explicitly states 'Preserves the existing schema.org JobPosting JSON-LD structured data script tag injected via useEffect' and the truncated note confirms it uses a useEffect hook injecting into document head. REQ-9 specifically requires the script tag to be rendered directly in the JSX return via dangerouslySetInnerHTML, not injected imperatively via useEffect. Additionally, Header.tsx was also modified (Careers navigate call pattern changed), which violates the constraint of only modifying CareersPage.tsx.",
