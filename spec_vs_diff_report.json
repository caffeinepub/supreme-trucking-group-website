  "summary": "REQ-4 is fully implemented. The diff shows that frontend/src/pages/CareersPage.tsx was modified to include a valid schema.org/JobPosting JSON-LD structured data block injected via a <script type='application/ld+json'> tag. The schema includes all required fields: title, datePosted, hiringOrganization, jobLocation, and applicantLocationRequirements. Two additional files were modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which are metadata/documentation files rather than application source files, so they do not violate the constraint of not modifying other frontend components or backend logic.",
